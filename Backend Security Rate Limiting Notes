Backend Security Rate Limiting Notes

1. Purpose:

Ensure API stability and prevent misuse.

Protect resources from excessive or automated requests.

Safeguard user data and backend servers.

2. How it Prevents Abuse:

Detects and blocks bots or scripts trying to spam APIs.

Limits the number of requests per user, IP, or API key within a specific time frame.

Helps avoid service crashes due to high traffic.

3. Common Techniques:

Rate Limiting: Restrict the number of API requests per time window (e.g., 100 requests/min).

Throttling: Slow down responses for excessive requests instead of blocking.

CAPTCHA: Ensure requests are made by humans.

Authentication & API Keys: Identify and limit requests per user or client.

IP Blacklisting / Whitelisting: Block known malicious IPs.

Web Application Firewall (WAF): Detect and block automated attacks.

4. Example (Node.js / Express Rate Limiter):

const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const apiLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per window
  message: "Too many requests, please try again later."
});

app.use('/api/', apiLimiter);


5. Key Takeaway:

Rate limiting and abuse prevention mechanisms protect APIs from bots and spamming, ensuring reliability and security.
