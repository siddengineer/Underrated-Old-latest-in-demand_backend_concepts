🔑 Underrated Backend Concepts

Rate Limiting & Throttling     https://nordicapis.com/api-rate-limiting-vs-api-throttling-how-are-they-different/   

Prevents abuse (e.g., bots spamming APIs) . https://github.com/siddengineer/Underrated-Old-latest-in-demand_backend_concepts/blob/main/Backend%20Security%20Rate%20Limiting%20Notes

Protects servers from overload.

Example: "Only 100 requests per minute per user."

Circuit Breakers & Retry Logic

If a downstream service is failing, don’t keep hammering it.

A circuit breaker stops requests temporarily → avoids cascading failures.

Example: Netflix Hystrix.

Idempotency

Ensures repeated requests don’t mess up data.

Example: Payment APIs should not double-charge if the same request is sent twice.

Caching Strategies

Everyone knows caching is important, but cache invalidation, cache warming, and stale-while-revalidate are underrated.

A smart cache can save 90%+ of load.

Database Connection Pooling

Instead of opening a new DB connection for every request, reuse a pool.

Saves memory, CPU, and improves latency.

Health Checks & Observability

Load balancing is useless if you don’t know whether a server is “healthy.”

Observability = logs + metrics + tracing (underrated until things break).

Message Queues (Async Processing)

Offloading tasks to queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS) keeps backend responsive.

Example: Instead of processing image upload instantly, enqueue → process later.

Graceful Shutdowns

When deploying new versions, servers should finish ongoing requests before shutting down.

Prevents half-completed transactions.

Data Sharding & Partitioning

Splitting large databases into smaller chunks for performance.

Example: Users with IDs 1–1M go to DB1, 1M–2M to DB2.

Consistency Models

Not everything needs strong consistency. Sometimes eventual consistency is fine (e.g., showing likes on Instagram).

Knowing when to pick which is a pro-level skill.

Backpressure Handling

When downstream systems can’t keep up, you must apply backpressure instead of flooding them.

Example: Drop, delay, or throttle requests safely.

Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)

In async systems, failed messages shouldn’t disappear. DLQs store them for later inspection.

Database Migrations & Schema Evolution

Many systems break because schema changes aren’t managed properly.

Example: Tools like Liquibase, Flyway.

Time Synchronization (NTP)

Distributed systems fail if clocks are out of sync.

Important for logging, security tokens, event ordering.

Feature Flags / Toggles

Deploy features gradually without redeploying code.

Safer than “big bang” releases.

Data Locality Awareness

Keep data close to where it’s processed.

Example: Storing EU customer data in EU servers for speed & compliance.

Request Deduplication

In high-traffic systems, duplicate requests are common.

Deduplication avoids wasted work (and bugs).

Graceful Degradation

System should provide “reduced service” instead of going completely down.

Example: Show cached data when DB is unavailable.

Rate-Adaptive APIs

Instead of fixed rate limits, APIs adjust dynamically based on load.

Keeps service alive under unexpected spikes.

TTL (Time-to-Live) Everywhere

Expire data you don’t need: cache entries, tokens, sessions, even temp files.

Saves memory, avoids “zombie data.”

Cold Starts & Warmups

Serverless/Lambda functions suffer from cold starts.

Pre-warming containers or functions avoids latency spikes.

Chaos Engineering

Intentionally break parts of the system to test resilience.

Netflix uses Chaos Monkey for this.

Multi-tenancy Isolation

SaaS apps must isolate customer data, even if stored in same DB.

Often ignored, but critical for security & compliance.

Correlation IDs in logs.

Metrics vs Logs vs Traces.

Red/Black or Blue/Green Deployments.

Canary Releases.

Feature Flags / Toggles.

Shadow Traffic (test new system with real traffic silently).

JWT Expiry & Refresh Flow.

Multi-tenancy Isolation.

Data Residency (keeping data in correct region).

Time Synchronization (NTP drift can break token
